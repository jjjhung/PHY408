# PHY408
Some stuff for the phy408 project, time series analysis

When viewing plots, they are in the plots/epoch_700/ folder, the other folder is for some checkpoints I made previously. 
The ordering for plots is also slightly strange, they should be viewed in the order corresponding to their number (not the order they appear in the folder on github).
